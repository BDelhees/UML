# UML
## Description

This repository is based on a lecture from the University of Lucerne in Applied Data Science. 
The goal of this lecture is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to a problem setting and write a paper with a detailed approach.
I evaluate whether a country is elgible for foreign aid via clustering based on its socio-economic characteristics.


## Technical Setup

Spyder (Python 3.8) was used to write the code. The scripts can be run in numerical order. 


## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this analysis is from Kaggle (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data ) and contains 167 countries and several socio-economic variables.
